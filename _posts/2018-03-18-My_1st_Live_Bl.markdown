There is a difference between a space and a place, which people are unaware of.
Space is supposed to be abstract and place is territorial. Space depends and constitutes of  how one uses that
place. According to Henri Lefebvre space has tripartite distinction: Spatial practice; which is the production
and reproduction of the space,Representations of space; meaning how it is conceived by the dominant structure
and Representational space; which is the experiences that is created of the people who live there everyday.


The ever increasing human desire of achieving comfort and luxury has lead to the ignorance of the natural
environment around us. The blind efforts of converting rural to urban without thinking of the consequences,
has cultivated a different perspective of the utilisation of space. Here is a small anecdote in the form a
beautiful song emphasising on the same.


The song Chennai Poromboke Paadal was released on released on January 14, 2017. Its an initiative by
T.M.Krishna and environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman. It is a Tamil song written by Kaber Vasuki and
composed by R. K. Shriramkumar. This song was written to raise awareness of the issues at Ennore creek.
They played with  the word “poromboke” which originally meant ‘places reserved for shared communal uses’
but now people use it as a disrespectful word, to devalue a person.


In the song he mentions that the Ennore creek is not for us; ‘not for you and me’
But for the community to use and for the ‘earth’. It is a natural resource which is being used extensively
and that we have to take care of it, it is our responsibility towards nature. He also mentions that the
disastrous flood that occurred and that we sulked a bit but did nothing, learned nothing from it.
We constructed more concrete buildings around and stopped the flow of lakes into the seas, Lakes were
labelled “poromboke” to wait for the rainwater, to wait for being filled with fresh waters.


Many power plants were built along the Ennore creek which polluted the waters by dumping fly ash and other
toxic materials in the sea. Having many industries in the vicinity, polluted not only the waters but the
air too, turning the white skies into black ones. Then he continues by saying after ‘he’ is done with the
Ennore ‘he’ will come for your city to destroy the livelihood. By ‘he’, they refer to the industries
(Kamarajar Port, Tangedco) which have taken over the creek. If you try to question them they put the mark
‘make in India’ to shut you and that growth, jobs, opportunities are just some lame excuses. They even mock
‘he’ by saying: “one who sold the waterbodies and lake is mere poromboke” and that we are poromboke for them too.
In the end he provokes the listeners, by saying that he is a poromboke, are we too?


There are many spatial practices in this context. The Industries are taking over the nature’s space,
the communities space; especially the fisherman’s. The fishermen’s livelihood is stolen by them,
fishermen cannot fish due to toxic waste dumped in the waterbodies. Even the residential community
spaces are affected. Their drinking water is being deteriorated, air pollution is increasing. They believe
that the industries were the cause of the floods. Their representation of “space” affects the representational
space.

The map above shows the evolution of the creek and how the increasing number of
industries are degrading the ecosystem around the creek.
